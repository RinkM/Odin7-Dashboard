# 8/14 Todo List

~~fix body grid and re-place the nav, header, and mainspace.~~
Header buttons.  move them to other side.
extend the search bar to fit
find avatars? logos?

take screenshots of projects. 
Or an ICON

waht about the css effect / cards?

ohhh man I'm so tired...




# THE PLAN

JavaScript Thouhgts
Make the cards in HTML.  Blank, but formatted. Make a practice one. Repeat.
Add object information.  USE SPANS?
Use javascript to fill them with things. 

    Project Cards

    A Form to enter the next projects. 
    It makes a new object. Cards are redrawn.  
    Grid shuffles them down? 

## Nav Bar
* ~~Find and Place Icons~~
* Logo and Title - Larger Font
* Spacing between Icons
* Where do links lead?  About me? 
* Font Sizes and Color. Something that is clear to read
* 


## Header
* Magnifying glass icon
* Do the buttuns function?
    * new post? Project?  Add to the page with Javascript?


### Top line of Header
* make the search bar do something?  
* Alarm Icon
* Avatar Icon
* Username

## Announcements



## Trending
* Find User Avatars - Like Rafikki or Fish
* OR something to do with my projects
* Make a componant line.   Add information to it/




## Your Projects

### The Cards
* background is an image of the app? 
name of app + picture? Somethign like that?
Hover gives you information. The description.
Click goes to the app.


## Javascript Card Making
So...  
if
    screenDiv = document.createElement("div");
    screenDiv.classList.add("screen");
    workspace2.appendChild(screenDiv);

the code to make and post 1 div.  


card1 = document.createElement("div");
screenDiv.classList.add("screen");
- add the ID#.  



Header Div: 

Line 1: Search bar, alerts, avatar name
Line 2: Welcome message  3 action buttons.

Main Div :

2 wide, many down.
