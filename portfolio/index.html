            I am a self-taught Software Developer with experience building apps in Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and SQL.  I have also worked with React and Bootstrap and other JavaScript libraries for website development.</p>
    
            <p>As a classroom teacher, I've written and designed courses for French, English, and Public Speaking. Teaching requires a skillset that is easily transferred into the developer role. As a language teacher, I am detail-oriented, manage my time well, and work with strict deadlines. </p>
